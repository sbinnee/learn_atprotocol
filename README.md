# AT Protocol App View Project

## Goal
Build a new App View for the AT Protocol that provides a unique social media experience. This App View will:
- Consume data from the AT Protocol network via Relays (firehose)
- Rely on Bluesky's existing PDS infrastructure for user data storage
- Provide network-wide aggregation and custom features
- Offer a distinct user experience complementing the AT Protocol ecosystem

## What is an App View?
An App View is a comprehensive social platform that aggregates data from across the entire AT Protocol network. It sits between the Relay layer (which provides the data firehose) and client applications (which users interact with).

## Project Status
Learning phase - studying AT Protocol concepts and architecture before implementation.
