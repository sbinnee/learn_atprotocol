# AT Protocol App View Project

## Project Goal

Build a new **App View** for the AT Protocol that provides a unique social media experience.

### What We're Building

An App View is a comprehensive social platform that:
- Consumes data from the AT Protocol network via **Relays** (the firehose)
- Aggregates network-wide information (posts, likes, follows, etc.)
- Provides custom features and user experience
- Complements the existing AT Protocol ecosystem

### Infrastructure Approach

- **PDS (Personal Data Servers)**: Rely on Bluesky's existing PDS infrastructure for user data storage
- **Relay**: Connect to AT Protocol Relays to receive the network-wide data firehose
- **App View**: Build our own App View layer for custom aggregation and features
- **Client**: Develop client applications for user interaction

### Development Approach

Learning and building with the help of AI assistants to:
1. Understand AT Protocol architecture and concepts
2. Design the App View's unique features
3. Implement the aggregation and indexing layer
4. Build client interfaces for users

## Current Phase

**Learning Phase** - Studying AT Protocol concepts, architecture, and best practices before implementation.
